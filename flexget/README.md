# FlexGet

Official website: [FlexGet](https://www.flexget.com/)

This directory requires the entire FlexGet code from GitHub and it uses submodules to achieve it. For more information on usage of submodules [here](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules) is a link.

This is a work in progress and in particular it will require correct user permissions to avoid conflicts if you decide to mount your own configuration.

Instructions:
```sh
docker build --tag flexget:rpi3 .
```
